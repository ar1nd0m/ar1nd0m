
Project Name: Banking Management System(early 2000s)


The Bank Management System is a desktop application built using Java Swing that allows a bank administrator to create, modify, delete, and manage customer bank accounts. The system provides a graphical interface for interaction, along with data persistence through file-based serialization.


To develop a GUI-based banking application that:
* Allows basic account operations (Create, Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer)
* Saves data persistently
* Provides an admin panel with real-time data display
* Is packaged as a standalone Windows .exe for ease of use
apparatus:
* Programming Language: Java
* GUI Framework: Java Swing
* Data Storage: File-based serialization (accounts.dat)
* Executable Wrapper: Launch4j (for converting .jar to .exe)
* IDE: NetBeans (recommended)

System Requirements:
   * Operating System: Windows / Linux
   * Java Version: JDK 8 or higher
   * Memory: Minimum 2 GB RAM
   * Disk: 10 MB for JRE + Application
   * Bundled JRE (optional): For .exe without needing system Java

Features:
      * Create new bank accounts with unique IDs
      * Deposit and withdraw money
      * Transfer between accounts
      * Search by name or ID
      * View all accounts
      * Track total number of transactions
      * Delete accounts
      * User-friendly Admin Panel GUI
      * Data saved locally in serialized form

System Design:
         * GUI components include:

            * Title bar with icon
            * Buttons panel (GridLayout)
            * Output panel (JTextPane)

               * All user interactions are handled via JOptionPane dialogs
               * Backend account logic encapsulated in a BankAccount class
               * Account data saved in accounts.dat





Class Structure:
1. BankAccount class
                  * Fields: name, address, type, uid, balance
                  * Static: no_of_trans (tracks transactions)
                  * Implements Serializable
2. BankGUI class
                  * Extends JFrame
                  * Contains:
                  * GUI setup in constructor
                  * Button action listeners
                  * Account operations (create, deposit, etc.)
                  * Methods to load/save accounts using object streams

Functionality Description:

Account Creation:

                     * Prompts for name, address, type, and balance
                     * Auto-generates UID
                     * Displays confirmation


Deposit:   
                     * Input account ID and amount
                     * Updates balance and transaction count


 Withdraw:
              * Verifies balance before deduction


Transfer:

                     * Input sender and receiver IDs
                     * Validates balance before transfer


Search;

                     * Search by name or account ID

Show All:

                     * Lists all accounts with details


delete Account:


                     * Prompts for confirmation before deletion


Total transaction:

                     *It counts total transection


Data Persistence:
                     * File: accounts.dat
                     * Format: Java object serialization (ObjectOutputStream)
                     * Data automatically loaded on application startup
                     * Safe saving on each operation


 Executable Conversion (JAR to EXE):
Step 1: Export JAR
                     * Build your project in NetBeans
                     * Ensure BankGUI is the main class
                     * Include resources (e.g. icon.png) in JAR
Step 2: Convert JAR to EXE using Launch4j
                     * Open Launch4j
                     * Set:

                        * Output file: BankApp.exe
                        * Jar: BankGUI.jar
                        * Bundled JRE path: (optional, e.g. jre)
                        * Classpath: leave as is if JAR is standalone

                           * Press Build Wrapper

Step 3: Run
                              * Double-click BankApp.exe
                              * App launches with GUI and functionality

How to Run the Project:(With JAR)

bash
java -jar BankGUI.jar

Conclusion:
The Bank Management System provides a simple, robust platform for managing customer bank data through a user-friendly GUI. Its portability via .exe conversion and persistent data storage makes it a practical mini-project for academic or personal learning purposes.
